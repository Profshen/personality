# Personality

This is my final project for Galvanize's Data Science Immersive.

This project explores different matrix factorization methods and their effectiveness
in pulling latent personality traits out of a personality data set.  The project also aims to reproduce the Big Five personality trait theory.
Using a custom written ensemble NMF algorithm, I was able to find 3 out 5 of the Big Five traits in the data set.
