# Personality

This is my final project for Galvanize's Data Science Immersive. This project uses nmf, pca, clustering and svd to pull latent personality traits out of a personality data set.

# Using Data Science to Find Underlying Personality Traits

The 16pf personality test was the first personality test to use factor analysis to mathematically dervied the latent personality traits in humans. The research by ___ resulted 
in the Big Five trait theory which states that human personality can be reduced down to 5 main traits. Within personality trait theory (or the belief that 
human personality has a set of universal "axes") Big Five is one of most scientifically replicated and supported theories.

My project features a data set of 47K respondents to the 16pf personality test to:
  (1) see if the Big Five theory can be replicated
  (2) understand how human personality varies by gender, country and age
  (3) create a new personality theory based on an interpretable result from nmf, svd or pca results
